TO-DO-LIST APP

In this app, the first page is for showing all tasks, and you can also search for them. I use the recycler view.  We can see our tasks in a list or grid view. And we can sort it by title and date. There is a button to add new task at bottom. After clicking on the new task button, the next page opens. I use card view to enter the task title and task description. After clicking on the save task button, we can move to the screen where we can see our tasks in the list view. We can also update our app by clicking on the update icon. If you want to see your tasks on grid view, there is specific button for that. I use adapter for creating recycler view. And Sqlite databse. For clean and structured code I use MVVM architecture.
